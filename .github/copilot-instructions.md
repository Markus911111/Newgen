# Copilot Instructions for Newgen

## Project Overview

Newgen is a Genspark telltale RPG (role-playing game) project. This repository contains the codebase for developing an interactive narrative-driven game experience.

## Project Type

This is an RPG game project with a focus on storytelling and player choices, similar to Telltale Games' style.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
- Write clear, self-documenting code with comments where necessary
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Ensure all changes are compatible with the project's game engine and framework

### Working with this Repository

1. **Before Making Changes**
   - Review the README.md for project context
   - Understand the game mechanics and narrative structure before modifying game logic
   - Check for existing tests and ensure new features have appropriate test coverage

2. **Testing**
   - Test game mechanics thoroughly before submitting changes
   - Verify that narrative branches work correctly
   - Ensure player choices lead to expected outcomes

3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation when adding new features or game mechanics
   - Document game narrative structures and decision trees
   - Keep the README.md updated with setup and usage instructions

### Best Practices for Game Development

- **Narrative Consistency**: Ensure story elements are consistent across branches
- **Player Experience**: Consider the player's perspective when implementing features
- **Performance**: Optimize for smooth gameplay experience
- **Save Systems**: Handle game state carefully to prevent data loss
- **Asset Management**: Organize game assets (images, audio, dialogue) logically

### Common Tasks

- **Adding New Story Branches**: Follow the existing narrative structure patterns
- **Implementing Game Mechanics**: Ensure they integrate well with existing systems
- **Bug Fixes**: Verify fixes don't break other game paths or states
- **UI/UX Changes**: Maintain consistency with the overall game design

## Current Project State

This project is in early stages. As the codebase grows, this file will be updated with:
- Specific build instructions
- Testing frameworks and commands
- Linting and code quality tools
- Deployment procedures
- Architecture documentation

## Getting Help

- Check the README.md for basic project information
- Review existing code patterns before implementing new features
- Ask for clarification on game design decisions if unclear
